# academic-projects
 
This repository contains a selection of my academic projects developed during my college and master's studies. The **C** and **C++** projects cover a range of topics from introductory linear programming to advanced OOP problem-solving, while the **Python** portion focuses on several NLP tasks related to feature engineering for classifiers, which is my master's research topic. This last one is still in a draft fashion, since it's an ongoing work.

Each subfolder contains source code files (`.c`, `.cpp`, `.h`, `.py`). These files represent core functionality but may exclude sensitive or specific assignment details to protect the integrity of academic guidelines.

## Usage

To compile and run any C or C++ projects, use the following commands in the terminal (example for a C project):

```bash
gcc filename.c -o outputname
./outputname
```

For Python scripts, simply execute:

```bash
python filename.py
```

## Topics Covered

* C Projects: Basic data structures, file handling, and algorithm implementation.
* C++ Projects: Object-oriented programming, STL, advanced data structures, and algorithms.
* Python Projects: NLP processing algorithms, data analysis, and basic machine learning algorithms.

##Disclaimer

These projects are solely for educational purposes and skill demonstration. Direct usage in coursework or assignments is discouraged, as it may violate academic policies.
